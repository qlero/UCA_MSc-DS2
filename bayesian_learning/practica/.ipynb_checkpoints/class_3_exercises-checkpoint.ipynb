For the rest of this exercise, we will assume z to follow a Gaussian distribution with these sample mean and standard deviation, and to be independent of x.

This distribution has a mean $\\mu = n*\\theta$, where n is the number of trials and a variance $\\sigma^{2} = n*\\theta(1-\\theta)$. Therefore we can compute estimates of the mean and variance of y for the different values of $\\theta$. In the case of $\\theta$ = 0.25 for instance, we would have $\\mu = 1000 * 0.25 = 250$, and $\\sigma^{2} = 1000 * 0.25 * 0.75 = 188$.
